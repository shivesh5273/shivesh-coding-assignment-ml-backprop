# Coding Assignment â€“ CS767: Advanced ML & Neural Networks

This repository contains my solutions for a computational assignment that focuses on:

- Manual construction of computational graphs
- Forward and backward propagation
- Verification of gradients using TensorFlow's `GradientTape`
- Binary classification visualization
- Regression using synthetic noisy data

## Topics Covered:
- Chain rule for partial derivatives
- Backpropagation by hand vs TensorFlow
- Gradient descent for line fitting
- Data visualization with matplotlib

## Tools Used:
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Matplotlib

---

### Sample Output:
The assignment includes a comparison of manual derivatives vs TensorFlow computed values:
d(f)/d(x): 1.755
d(f)/d(y): 0.25
d(f)/d(z): 6.0
These match exactly with TensorFlow outputs.
